#1. Writing Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Programs
To write maintainable and adaptable code, I focused on modular design, breaking the code into smaller parts like the CRUD Python module so each part has one job. This approach makes the code easier to test and reuse. I used straightforward names for variables and functions to ensure the code is easy to understand. Additionally, I added comments and docstrings to explain what the code does, which will help when I revisit the code later or share it with others.

The advantages of working this way are clear. The CRUD module is reusable in other projects that need database interactions. If something goes wrong, it’s easier to pinpoint the issue because the code is well-organized. Moreover, if the project needs to change, I can update one part without affecting the whole system. In the future, I could adapt this CRUD module for different databases or other projects that require database operations.

#2. Problem-Solving as a Computer Scientist
When tackling this project, I broke down the requirements into smaller tasks. For example, I focused on getting the CRUD module to work first, then connected it to the dashboard. This methodical approach helped me stay organized and made the project less overwhelming. Compared to past assignments, this project required more integration between different parts, such as the database and user interface. Moving forward, I’ll continue breaking down complex problems into manageable pieces and use similar strategies to meet other client needs.

#3. The Role of Computer Scientists
Computer scientists solve problems using code. In this project, I built a system that helps Grazioso Salvare manage and analyze animal data more efficiently. This kind of work matters because it streamlines operations, saves time, and provides better insights. For a company like Grazioso Salvare, this means they can focus more on their mission and less on managing data.
